# testYourJavaScriptSkills

How well do you know JavaScript? This 4 question quiz is goal-oriented to test your mutiple-choice-test-taking-skills while providing you with feedback about whether your guess is correct or wrong- resulting in time being taken from the clock. In the end there's a chance to initial your bragging rights.

#### The overall plan:

The idea was to create an html page that replaced attributes through manipulating the D.O.M. using JavaScript. This was done by manipulating what was viewable, when it was viewable, and how long it was viewable for. This project included a timer, a high score keeper, and many button manipulations.

#### current progress:

This project is still under construction. As of now it isn't styled how I'd like it to be. It's not fully functional or ready to be user friendly.

I have yet to fully get my nextButton and on functioning. I am currently working on setting up event listeners for the A, B, C, & D buttons, correct answer display, and how to decreement the clock if the user gets an answer wrong. followed by a loop and a way out on the last question. The end should have a remaining timer of sorts or ran out of time, and kicking them out of the questions portion. I want to let that be the high score decider for the gamescores.

I have an empty html file at this point for my scoreboard, an empty js file for the scoreboard page, and plan on wrapping up the project once I have it looking more like a quiz and not an near empty css file.
